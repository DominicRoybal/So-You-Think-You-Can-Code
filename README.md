## User Story
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Description
The goal of my challange is to clean unecisary code, change the codebase to uphold semantic html elements, and make sure the website functions do not change.

## Usage
​The use of this website is to get more information on a company called Horizon.

The top of the webpage is used to guide the user through the different sections of the webpage. The three listed headers are built to be user friendly. By clicking on the header it will automatically drag your screen to that specific section of the webpage.

The website has 2 main sections.

The first section has 3 list items in their own boxes.
The three listed items each have pictures. They are also backed up by a description of the pictures if the pictures do not appear. The three listed items all have descriptions of their purposes and they all have the same syle.

The second section also has three listed items. They have a slightly smaller title because their listed items are a subsection of the webpage. They all have pictures with descriptions of the pictures if they do not appear. They are all styled the same and have descriptions describing the titles purpose. 
​
The foot of the website is used to describe who made the website and the companies information.
​
## Features
The only feature this project uses is a hypertext reference to move the user with the click of a button to that section of the webpage.
